# TextCipher

This program is a Caesar Cipher built in Python 3 using tkinter.  I developed this in order to show my proficiency in the language.
The Text Cipher is a GUI with images, text, user input, message boxes, and more.
The Cipher itself uses a shift of 8, and shifts in both upper and lower case text.  Any numbers or symbols are passed through as is.
